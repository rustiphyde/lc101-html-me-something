          <h2>What The Heck Is Pareidolia?</h2>
          <p>
            According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, <b>"Pareidolia"</b> is
            <em
              >the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful image in a
              random or ambuiguous visual pattern.</em
            >
            I'm sure at some point in your life you've seen a cloud that
            reminded you of something else &mdash; whether that was a turtle, a
            dragon or <em>Homer Simpson</em>, it's all pareidolia!

            Take a look at the picture above this paragraph. It is simply a tree
            located in Jefferson Barracks Park. Apart from having an oddly
            placed set of stairs behind it, do you see anything interesting
            about this tree? Does it <em>remind</em> you of anything? Does it
            seem out of place in this temperate climate?

          <h2>What the Rorschach is Going On Here?</h2>
          <p>
            If you thought you were seeing a specific animal in the shape of the
            tree above, you're not alone. The mind works in mysterious ways and
            it's able to find patterns in just about anything.

            The picture below is one of many taken of a church located in Tampa
            Bay, Florida that a lot of people claim looks like a
            <em>giant chicken</em>! Do you see the resemblance? I personally
            think it looks like a very <em>cartoonish</em> one, but a chicken
            none the less.

          <h2>Seeing Faces Everywhere</h2>
          <p>
            I have had pareidolia for as long as I can remember. I can see faces
            in the most random objects. Look around you. Does anything look like
            a face? An animal? A famous character or religious figure? If so you
            have pareidolia too. Don't be sad. You are not alone in the world.
            There are countless groups on <b>Facebook</b> dedicated to seeing faces in the weirdest
            places &mdash; such as this one:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thingswithfaces/"
              >Things With Faces</a
            >. So take some pictures of what you see and share them with world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've included some pictures I took on my Android phone of various
            items that remind me of faces. <b>ENJOY!</b>
